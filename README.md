# react-transition-group

Abstracted from the react addon, for now the docs here still apply

https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html

Names changed slightly:

```js
import TransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/TransitionGroup'

import CSSTransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/CSSTransitionGroup'
```
Or alternatively:
```js
import { TransitionGroup, CSSTransitionGroup } from 'react-transition-group'
```
