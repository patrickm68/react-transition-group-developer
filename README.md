# react-transition-group

A fork, and "drop in" replacement for the original React TransitionGroup addons. Eventually this package can supercede the original addon, letting the React team focus on other stuff and giving these components a chance to get the attention they deserve out on their own. See: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8125 for more context.

A ton of thanks to the React team, and contributors for writing and maintaining these components for so long!

We are still in the process of extracting everything, and in particular we don't have new docs up yet. Please bear with us and in the meantime the original documentation is still applicable.

Names changed slightly:

```js
import TransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/TransitionGroup'

import CSSTransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/CSSTransitionGroup'
```
Or alternatively:
```js
import { TransitionGroup, CSSTransitionGroup } from 'react-transition-group'
```
